I analyzed the performances of the players in the last 9 seasons.
To evaluate their seasonal ratings, I took into account the number of goals they scored and the number of assists they made.
I conducted a regression analysis between these two variables and the seasonal rating, which is the only dependent variable.
Even though there is no strong linear relationship between the two independent variables and the seasonal rating, we can still talk about linearity.
